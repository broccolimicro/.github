## Tooling

It is well known that starting a VLSI design company is challenging,
particularly because of the many up front costs faced by such companies. In
recognition of these challenges, we feel it is our responsibility to copy-left
open source all of our progress in tooling development. Only by working
together can nascent VLSI design companies succeed in breaking down these
walls, and this Github organization represents our contribution toward that
effort.
